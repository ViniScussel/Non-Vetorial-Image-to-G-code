# Non-Vetorial-Image-to-G-code
A project (discontinued) in parter with LABI (IFTM-CAUPT) that transcript an image (.png, .svg, .jpg, etc...) to g-code. Since I am working with CNC machines, the script will be more efficient on those.

feel free to use it as you want it (nothing illegal) and ask me questions about.

the project is no longer under development because LABI owned a proper CNC and no longer we need this
